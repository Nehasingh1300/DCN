# Network Layer
Logical address is assigned.
IPv4 add are 32 bit add, no two device have same IP add
add space = 2^32


## netid hostid
the use of hostid and netid is to tell the number of network and corresponding hosts we have

## mask  : help in finding netid and hostid

A8 B16 C24
when we get netid as 1 then only we can go to host and put host as 1

Casting : sending packet from one host to another host
Unicast : one host to another
Braodcast : one host send packet to every host in other network
multicast : one host in network to all host in another network

Mask 20.255.255.255 = 2^24 -2 host IP

We have one IP and with that we have connected a subnet mask which has many hosts ? Does this mean we are providing many hosts a single Ip with use of a subnet mask?For eg; 192.168.0.1/24 then inside this IP we have 2^8 -2 hosts, so inside this Ip we have these many hosts!
 Are mask and subnetting connected?  
 
 mask : network -> mask -> host
 subnetting : network -> group -> mask -> host
 
For subnetting ; as I think it is just for classification purposes and subnetting is not increasing any host number.
One more question: how do we provide IP to many hosts?191.168.0.0/16 191.168.0.1191.168.0.255
191.168.1.0191.168.255.255    

Is this how we divide for class B?
