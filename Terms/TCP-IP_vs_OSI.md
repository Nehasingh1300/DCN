# Difference between TCP/IP and OSI Model

***TCP/IP***
Transmisson Control and Internet Protocol<br>
It is **Practical Model**, which means it is used for link establishment and network interation.<br>
4 Layers<br>
It does not ensure transfer of complete packet, it uses two protocols; TCP and UDP<br>
It follows vertical approach as the four protocol stack is followed to transfer of message<br>


<br>***OSI Model***
Open System Interconnection.<br>
It is **Conceptual Model**, it defines how data is transferred through network.<br>
7 Layers<br>
It ensures that the whole message is sent in sequence, this is done by **Transport Layer**, if any packet is missing then it will sent a request to resend that packet.<br>
It follows horizontal approach as it connects two computers and the 7 layers are managed simultaneously.<br>
