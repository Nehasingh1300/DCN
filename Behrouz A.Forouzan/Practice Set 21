1. Is the size of the ARP packet fixed? Explain.
no, it changes with Sender hardware address, Sender protocol address,Target hardware address,
Target protocol address


2. What is the size of an ARP packet when the protocol is IPv4 and the hardware is
Ethernet?
16+16+8+8+16+6+4+6+4 = 20 + 48 + 16  = 84 bytes


3. What is the size of an Ethernet frame carrying an ARP packet in Question 2?
64 + sender hardware add+ sender protocol add


4. What is the broadcast address for Ethernet?

With limited broadcast, an IP address is given as a destination. This IP address is always 255.255.255.255.
Technically, this broadcast should be sent to all the IP addresses that exist.
However, it actually serves as an address for the broadcast within the network.
This destination is always in its own network and can therefore be implemented in an Ethernet broadcast.
A router does not forward such a packet.


5. Why is there a restriction on the generation of an ICMPv4 message in response to
a failed ICMPv4 error message?

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite. 
It is chiefly used by the operating systems of networked computers to send error messages indicating, 
for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. 
ICMP can also be used to relay query messages.


6. What is the purpose of including the IPv4 header and the first 8 bytes of datagram
data in the error-reporting ICMPv4 messages?

The original datagram header is added to give the original source, which receives the error message;
its type what has to done next and where to forward this msg further,
information about the datagram itself.



7. Give an example of a situation in which a host would never receive a redirection
message.

when msg is send with ttl value 0 and the when it move from host to router then its
ttl is decreased to 0 and so router discard that msg and no redirection msg is send


8. What is the minimum size of an ICMPv4 packet? What is the maximum size of an
ICMPv4 packet?
Minimum : 64 bytes
maximum : 1518 bytes


9. What is the minimum size of an IPv4 packet that carries an ICMPv4 packet? What
is the maximum size?

 This 16-bit field defines the entire packet size in bytes, including header and data.
 The minimum size is 20 bytes (header without data) and the maximum is 65,535 bytes.


10. How can we determine if an IPv4 packet is carrying an ICMPv4 packet?
Just need to check if the 10th byte of the packet (Protocol field) matches ICMPâ€™s protocol 
number (= 1, from /etc/protocols).

11. What is the minimum size of an Ethernet frame that carries an IPv4 packet which
in turn carries an ICMPv4 packet? What is the maximum size?

"The minimum size would be 64 bytes if we do not consider the preamble and SFD fields,
which are added at the physical layer. The maximum size would be 1518 bytes,
again not considering the preamble and SFD fields. Although the maximum size of an ICMP
packet can be much more than 1500 bytes (for a router advertisement packet),
Ethernet can carry only 1500 bytes of it."


12. Why is there no need for the ICMPv4 message to travel outside its own network?
Broadcast address is the address on which all devices connected to the network can receive the datagram or packet.
Unlike IP address which is addressed to a specific device, the datagram sent on a broadcast address is
received by all devices in the network. There is no need for the ICMP message to travel outside its own network because,
its purpose is to inform the next router in its spanning tree or the host/device (if on the same network) about the issue.


Exercises
13. A router with IPv4 address 125.45.23.12 and Ethernet physical address
23:45:AB:4F:67:CD has received a packet for a host destination with IP address
125.11.78.10. Show the entries in theARP request packet sent by the router. Assume
no subnetting.


14. Show the entries in the ARP packet sent in response to Exercise 13.


15. Encapsulate the result of Exercise 13 in a data link frame. Fill in all the fields.


16. Encapsulate the result of Exercise 14 in a data link frame. Fill in all the fields


17. Host A sends a datagram to host B. Host B never receives the datagram, and host A
never receives notification of failure. Give two different explanations of what might
have happened.


18. Calculate the checksum for the following ICMP packet:
Type: Echo Request Identifier: 123 Sequence number: 25 Message: Hello


19. A router receives an IPv4 packet with source IP address 130.45.3.3 and destination
IP address 201.23.4.6. The router cannot find the destination IP address in its routing
table. Which ICMPv4 message should be sent?


20. TCP receives a segment with destination port address 234. TCP checks and cannot
find an open port for this destination. Which ICMPv4 message should be sent?


21. A multicast address for a group is 231.24.60.9. What is its 48-bit Ethernet address
for a LAN using TCPIIP?


22. If a router has 20 entries in its group table, should it send 20 different queries periodically orjust one? Explain your answer.


23. If a host wants to continue membership in five groups, should it send five different
membership report messages or just one?


24. A router on an Ethernet network has received a multicast IP packet with groupid
226.17.18.4. When the host checks its multicast group table, it finds this address.
Show how the router sends this packet to the recipients by encapsulating the IP
packet in an Ethernet frame. Show all the entries of the Ethernet frame. The outgoing
IP address of the router is 185.23.5.6, and its outgoing physical address is
4A224512E1E2. Does the router need the services of ARP?


25. A host with IPv4 address 114.45.7.9 receives an IGMP query. When it checks its
group table, it finds no entries. What action should the host take? Should it send
any messages?


26. A host with IPv4 address 222.5.7.19 receives an IGMP query. When it checks its
routing table, it finds two entries in its table: 227.4.3.7 and 229.45.6.23. What
action should the host take? Should it send any messages? If so, what type and how
many?
