Review Questions
1. What is the difference between the delivery of a frame in the data link layer and the
delivery of a packet in the network layer?

The data link layer groups the physical bits from the Physical layer into Frames/Packets. 
The Data link layer provides device-to-device delivery of packets while Network layer provides
network to network delivery of packets.


2. What is the difference between connectionless and connection-oriented services?
Which type of service is provided by IPv4? Which type of service is provided by IPv6?

                  connectionless                                    connection-oriented services

Network layer protocol treats each packet independently              connection is made before sending packets
 and each packet sent separatly  

no relationship among packets                                        relatioship among packets

Packets in msg may or may not travel through same path in            packet sent through  same path in sequential order
to their destination

two consecutive packets may travel through same packet               two consecutive packets are connected/related


IPv4 - conectionless
IPv6 - conectionless


3. Define fragmentation and explain why the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols need to fragment
some packets. Is there any difference between the two protocols in this matter?


4. Explain the procedure for checksum calculation and verification in the IPv4 protocol.
What part of an IPv4 packet is covered in the checksum calculation? Why? Are
options, if present, included in the calculation?
5. Explain the need for options in IPv4 and list the options mentioned in this chapter
with a brief description of each.
6. Compare and contrast the fields in the main headers of IPv4 and IPv6. Make a table
that shows the presence or absence of each field.
7. Both IPv4 and IPv6 assume that packets may have different priorities or precedences.
Explain how each protocol handles this issue.
8. Compare and contrast the options in IPv4 and the extension headers in IPv6. Make
a table that shows the presence or absence of each.
9. Explain the reason for the elimination of the checksum in the IPv6 header.
10. List three transition strategies to move from IPv4 to IPv6. Explain the difference
between tunneling and dual stack strategies during the transition period. When is
each strategy used?
Exercises
11. Which fields of the IPv4 header change from router to router?
12. Calculate the HLEN (in IPv4) value if the total length is 1200 bytes, 1176 of which
is data from the upper layer.
13. Table 20.5 lists the MTUs for many different protocols. The MTUs range from 296
to 65,535. What would be the advantages of having a large MTU? What would be
the advantages of having a small MTU?
14. Given a fragmented datagram (in IPv4) with an offset of 120, how can you determine
the first and last byte numbers?
15. Can the value of the header length in an IPv4 packet be less than 5? When is it
exactly 5?
16. The value ofHLEN in an IPv4 datagram is 7. How many option bytes are present?
17. The size of the option field of an IPv4 datagram is 20 bytes. What is the value of
HLEN? What is the value in binary?
18. The value of the total length field in an IPv4 datagram is 36, and the value of the
header length field is 5. How many bytes of data is the packet carrying?
19. An IPv4 datagram is carrying 1024 bytes of data. Ifthere is no option information,
what is the value of the header length field? What is the value of the total length
field?
20. A host is sending 100 datagrams to another host. Ifthe identification number of the
first datagram is 1024, what is the identification number of the last (in IPv4)?
21. An IPv4 datagram arrives with fragmentation offset of 0 and an M bit (more fragment
bit) of O. Is this a first fragment, middle fragment, or last fragment?
22. An IPv4 fragment has arrived with an offset value of 100. How many bytes of data
were originally sent by the source before the data in this fragment?
SECTION 20.8 PRACTICE SET 609
23. An IPv4 datagram has arrived with the following information in the header (in
hexadecimal):
Ox45 00 00 54 00 03 58 50 20 06 00 00 7C 4E 03 02 B4 OE OF 02
a. Is the packet corrupted?
b. Are there any options?
c. Is the packet fragmented?
d. What is the size of the data?
e. How many more routers can the packet travel to?
f. What is the identification number of the packet?
g. What is the type of service?
24. In an IPv4 datagram, the M bit is 0, the value of HLEN is 5, the value of total
length is 200, and the offset value is 200. What is the number of the first byte and
number of the last byte in this datagram? Is this the last fragment, the first fragment,
or a middle fragment?
