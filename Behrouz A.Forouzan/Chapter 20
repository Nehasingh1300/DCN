ADDRESS MAPPING
A physical address is a local address. Its jurisdiction is a local network. It must be
unique locally, but is not necessarily unique universally.
The physical address and the logical address are two different identifiers. We need
both because a physical network such as Ethernet can have two different protocols at
the network layer such as IP and IPX (Novell) at the same time

Static mapping involves in the creation of a table that associates a logical address
with a physical address. This table is stored in each machine on the network.

This has some limitations because physical addresses may
change in the following ways:
1. A machine could change its NIC{network interface controller}, resulting in a new physical address.
2. In some LANs, such as LocalTalk, the physical address changes every time the
computer is turned on.
3. A mobile computer can move from one physical network to another, resulting in a
change in its physical address.

In dynamic mapping each time a machine knows one of the two addresses (logical
or physical), it can use a protocol to find the other one.

ARP (address resolution protocol)
Anytime a host or a router has an IP datagram to send to another host or router, it has the
logical (IP) address of the receiver. The logical (IP) address is obtained from the DNS
if the sender is the host or it is found in a routing table 
if the sender is a router. But the IP datagram must be encapsulated in a frame to be able to
pass through the physical network.The host or the router sends an ARP query packet. The packet includes
the physical and IP addresses of the sender and the IP address of the receiver. Because
the sender does not know the physical address of the receiver, the query is broadcast
over the network .

Cache Memory
If system A has to send packets to system B and it sends ARP reqest everyitme rather it can broadcast
files to network. So, it should rather save the address to its cache memory and hence from next time check
it any mapping is there.

Sender know IP of target
Sender send ARP request using  it, with sender IP, physical add and target IP but target physical add is 0
Message is passed to data link layer where encapsulated with physical add within frame, physical braodcast add as destination add
every host and router receive the arp req but only targeted has packet
targeted reply with physical add as arp reply
source receive add and IP datagram which has add , send encapsulated frame with destination add.

 Proxy ARP       
 It is technique which create subnetting effect. Whenever a router running proxy ARP receives a ARP request for any host 
 among a set of host inder it, It sends it own physical add and whe get the IP packet it sends the packet to target host.
 
 Mapping Physical to Logical Address: RARP, BOOTP, and DHCP
There are occasions in which a host knows its physical address, but needs to know its
logical address. This may happen in two cases:
1. A diskless station is just booted. The station can find its physical address by checking
its interface, but it does not know its IP address.
2. An organization does not have enough IP addresses to assign to each station; it needs
to assign IP addresses on demand. The station can send its physical address and
ask for a short time lease.

Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) 

Each host or router is assigned one or more logical
(IP) addresses, which are unique and independent of the physical (hardware) address
To create an IP datagram, a host or a router needs to know its own IP
address or addresses. The IP address of a machine is usually read from its configuration
file stored on a disk file.

A RARP request is created and broadcast on the local network.
Another machine on the local network that knows all the IP addresses will respond with
a RARP reply. The requesting machine must be running a RARP client program; the
responding machine must be running a RARP server program.

 RARP
 subnet mask ??
 It determines the  number of netid and hostid you have
 255.255.255.0
 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
 netid--------------------- hostid--
 
 does subnetting provides more IPs?
 
 To be able to use the protocol successfully, the RARP server has to be located in the same physical network.
 The computer sends the RARP request on the lowest layer of the network. As a result, it is not possible for a
 router to forward the packet.
 transport layer for server
 network layer for ip
 {are server and routers in diff layer?}
 
 In addition, the RARP cannot handle subnetting because no subnet masks are sent. 
 If the network has been divided into multiple subnets, an RARP server must be available in each one.
 what is the use of subnet mask here?
