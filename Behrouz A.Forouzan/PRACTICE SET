19.6 PRACTICE SET
Review Questions
1. What is the number of bits in an IPv4 address? What is the number of bits in an
IPv6 address?

IPv4 32
IPv6 128


2. What is dotted decimal notation in IPv4 addressing? What is the number of bytes
in an IPv4 address represented in dotted decimal notation? What is hexadecimal
notation in IPv6 addressing? What is the number of digits in an IPv6 address represented in hexadecimal notation?

IPv4 : 4bytes 8bits each eg; 117.149.29.2

IPv6 : 16bytes 128bits 
FDEC 0074 0000 0000 0000 BOFE 0000 FFFF (2BYTES EACH)


3. What are the differences between classful addressing and classless addressing in IPv4?

Classful                                            Classless
It has classes like A,B,C,D and E                   It does not classes
Almost obsolete                                     Not obsolete
Large part of available add is wasted               Add are not wasted
IP are divided inform of classes                    IP are divided in form of blocks and subnetting


4. List the classes in classful addressing and define the application of each class (unicast,
multicast, broadcast, or reserve).

Unicast Addresses
A unicast address defines a single computer. The packet sent to a unicast address must
be delivered to that specific computer. IPv6 defines two types of unicast addresses: geographically based and provider-based. 

Multicast Addresses
Multicast addresses are used to define a group of hosts instead ofjust one. A packet sent
to a multicast address must be delivered to each member of the group.

Broadcast
An address that enables transmission to every node in a local network. The address is the highest numeric value of the address format
being used. An Ethernet broadcast address is all binary 1's. An IP broadcast address is the highest number in its class; for example, 
the broadcast address of a Class C 192.168.

Reserved Addresses
Another category in the address space is the reserved address. These addresses start
with eight Os (type prefix is 00000000)



5. Explain why most of the addresses in class A are wasted. Explain why a medium-size
or large-size corporation does not want a block of class C addresses.

A block in class A address is too large for almost any organization. This means most of the 
addresses in class A were wasted and were not used. A block in class C is probably too small for
many organizations.


6. What is a mask in IPv4 addressing? What is a default mask in IPv4 addressing?

32-bit number made of contiguous 1's follwed by contigous 0's. The mask can help us to find the netid and the hostid. Default mask 255.0.0.0.


7. What is the network address in a block of addresses? How can we find the network
address if one of the addresses in a block is given?

The first address is called the
network address and defines the organization network.
The first address in a block is normally not assigned to any device; it is used as the
network address that represents the organization to the rest of the world.
Eg; if any random add is 205.16.37.34/28
then formula for first add = add with replacing log(2^(32-28))=4 with 9;s from right
34 in binary is 000100010 will be 00010000 
So, first add / network add = 205.16.37.32


8. Briefly define subnetting and supemetting. How do the subnet mask and supemetn
mask differ from a default mask in classful addressing?

If an organization was
granted a large block in class A or B, it could divide the addresses into several contiguous
groups and assign each group to smaller networks (called subnets) or, in rare cases,
share part of the addresses with neighbors.

The size of a class C block with a
maximum number of 256 addresses did not satisfy the needs of most organizations.
Even a midsize organization needed more addresses. One solution was supernetting.
In supernetting, an organization can combine several class C blocks to create a larger
range of addresses. In other words, several networks are combined to create a supernetwork or a supemet. An organization can apply for a set of class C blocks instead of
just one. For example, an organization that needs 1000 addresses can be granted four
contiguous class C blocks. The organization can then use these addresses to create one
supernetwork. Supernetting decreases the number of Is in the mask. For example, if an
organization is given four class C addresses, the mask changes from /24 to /22.


9. How can we distinguish a multicast address in IPv4 addressing? How can we do so
in IPv6 addressing?

Multicast Addresses
IPv4
"Multicast addresses in IPv4 are those that start with the 1110 pattern. Multicast addresses in IPv6 are those that start with the 11111111 pattern."

IPv6
Multicast addresses are used to define a group of hosts instead ofjust one. A packet sent
to a multicast address must be delivered to each member of the group. Figure 19.17
shows the format of a multicast address.
The second field is a flag that defines the group address as either permanent or
transient. A permanent group address is defined by the Internet authorities and can be
accessed at all times. A transient group address, on the other hand, is used only temporarily. Systems engaged in a teleconference, for example, can use a transient group
address. The third field defines the scope of the group address. Many different scopes
have been defined


10. What is NAT? How can NAT help in address depletion?

NAT enables a user to have a large set of addresses internally and one address, or a small
set of addresses, externally. The traffic inside can use the large set; the traffic outside, the
small set.
Using Both IP Addresses and Port Numbers To allow a many-to-many relationship
between private-network hosts and external server programs, we need more information
in the translation table. For example, suppose two hosts with addresses 172.18.3.1 and
172.18.3.2 inside a private network need to access the HTTP server on external host
566 CHAPTER 19 NETWORK LAYER: LOGICAL ADDRESSING
25.8.3.2. Ifthe translation table has five columns, instead of two, that include the source
and destination port numbers ofthe transport layer protocol, the ambiguity is eliminated.


Exercises
II. What is the address space in each of the following systems?

a. A system with 8-bit addresses : 2^8
b. A system with 16-bit addresses : 2^16
c. A system with 64-bit addresses : 2^64


12. An address space has a total of 1024 addresses. How many bits are needed to represent an address?

IPv4 requires 32 bits
for 1024 32x1024 = 32768 bits

IPv6 requires 128 bits
for 1024 128x1024 = 131072 bits


13. An address space uses the three symbols 0, 1, and 2 to represent addresses.
If each address is made of 10 symbols, how many addresses are available in this
system?

As there are three variables and 10 bits so address space will be 3^10 = 59049 addresses.

28. An ISP has a block of 1024 addresses. It needs to divide the addresses among
1024 customers. Does it need subnetting? Explain your answer.

  Yes, it depends on the type of organisation is going to use those IPs if people 
  are normal users then they can simply use without subnetting but if there is an
  organisation which has subgroups and they also have subgroups then there is need 
  of subnetting.
